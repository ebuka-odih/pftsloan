					<description><![CDATA[This is an easy to understand guide on “how to get a loan in Nigeria”. It is also a comprehensive]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This is an easy to understand guide on “how to get a loan in Nigeria”. It is also a comprehensive guide, which means you will find what you need to know about taking loans in Nigeria here.</p>



<p>Before you proceed to know how to get a loan in Nigeria, you must first understand what a loan is. If you already fully understand what a loan is, you can skip the “What Is A Loan” Section.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What is a loan?</h2>



<p>A loan is money that is borrowed, which is repaid after an agreed amount of time with the specified interest on it. This interest is a percentage of the original amount borrowed.</p>



<p>The amount of money borrowed is called the principal. For every month that passes after you’ve borrowed the money, a percentage of this principal will be added for you to pay back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The money added after each month for the entire period of the loan is called the interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, if you were to take a loan of&nbsp; ₦100 Naira from any lender at 10% interest every month for 6 months, it means that 10% of ₦100 Naira&nbsp; (which is ₦10 Naira) would be added to the #100 Naira you borrowed every month for 6 months.</p>



<p>This means that at the end of the 6 months you would have to pay back ₦160 Naira to the bank/platform you borrowed money from. The principal is ₦100 Naira, while the interest is the extra ₦60 Naira after the 6 months period.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Where can you get a loan from in Nigeria</h2>



<p>There are a lot of places to borrow money from in Nigeria.&nbsp;Here are a few of your options<em>:</em></p>



<ul><li>Traditional Banks I.e&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gtbank.com/personal-banking/loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTbank</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zenithbank.com/personal-banking/loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenith Bank</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.firstbanknigeria.com/personal/loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Bank</a></li><li>Online Lenders I.e&nbsp;<a href="https://nmfb.com.ng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nirsal</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.renmoney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renmoney</a></li><li>App Platforms from Google Play I.e FairMoney&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>How can you get a loan in Nigeria? </h2>



<p>Before you apply for a loan, you must know what you want to do with the loan. This will be very helpful because it will reduce the amount of interest you have to pay when paying back the loan.</p>



<p>What do you need the loan for? Is it for personal issues? To buy a car? To pay rent or buy a new house? For your small business or just to have in case the salary does not come early.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asking these questions is always the best place to start from. As an example, if you need a loan to get a new car, you’re better off with a&nbsp;<a href="https://creditnigeria.com/car-loan">car loan</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>that can use the car as collateral which would attract lesser interest than taking a&nbsp;<a href="https://creditnigeria.com/personal-loan">personal loan</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>or an&nbsp;<a href="https://creditnigeria.com/emergency-loan">emergency loan</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>to buy the car.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How can you actually get a loan?</h2>



<p>There are many ways to access loans in Nigeria and the easiest kinds of loans you can get as of now are&nbsp;<a href="https://creditnigeria.com/">online Loans.</a></p>



<p>With a simple search on the internet you can find a trusted online lender willing to offer you short term funds to cover emergencies. These kinds of loans usually take a few minutes to access and all you need for the application forms are a few details. Usually your:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Name</li><li>Bank Verification Number (BVN)</li><li>Bank Statement(sometimes)</li><li>Identification card – preferably a government-issued card.</li><li>Bank Account Details</li></ul>



<p>After putting in the required details and the amount of loan you wish to take, the loan only takes a few minutes to be approved and you will receive the money into your bank account shortly after.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another way to get a loan is to physically visit the bank. Like most online platforms, Banks also have online sites where you can begin the process of taking a loan from. These bank websites also require you to fill and submit an application form that generally asks for:</p>



<ul><li>A verifiable source of income I.e a savings account or a bank statement&nbsp;</li><li>A government-issued identification card&nbsp;</li><li>A utility Bill (like PHCN/NEPA light bill)</li><li>Your Bank Verification Number</li><li>Reason for Loan</li><li>Payment Tenure</li></ul>



<p>Some of these banks require you to have an account with them before accessing the loans while some do not.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Interest rates of loans in Nigeria</h2>



<p>If you have read the ‘What Is A Loan’ section, you must have a basic understanding of what interest rates are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Different lenders have different interest rates depending on what kinds of loans you wish to take. These interest rates are also not fixed as it varies on several factors from salary range to the type of collateral involved. Collateral is a property offered in case the payment of the loan does not go as planned.</p>



<p>Not everyone has collateral to offer, but the lack of collateral does not stop you from taking loans because there are online platforms willing to offer loans with no collateral involved. Five platforms that give loans without collateral include:</p>



<ul><li>SMEDAN</li><li>AELLA-CREDIT</li><li>PAYLATER</li><li>ONE-FI</li><li>SPECTA</li></ul>



<h2>Credit Nigeria find you loans easily</h2>



<p>If you want to get the best collateral-free loan offers from trusted platforms, <a href="/">use Credit Nigeria</a>. Credit Nigeria is an online loan search platform that helps you search for the best available loans from trustworthy lenders without any collateral involved.</p>



<p>Credit Nigeria will also help you compare all the available loan options for you, so you can choose the best loan option that fits your budget.&nbsp;Credit Nigeria is free and easy to use, with no hidden charges and no stress.&nbsp;</p>

		<title>Is It Possible To Get A Loan Withouth A BVN?</title>

					<description><![CDATA[A loan can be collected from different sources, and this is the major factor that will determine if a Bank]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A loan can be collected from different sources, and this is the major factor that will determine if a Bank Verification Number (BVN) is required or not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the loan is collected from a friend or an association, you might not need a BVN because of the level of trust between you and your friend or the association.&nbsp;<strong>A BVN is however needed to get a&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://creditnigeria.com/"><strong>loan from banks</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;and other verified private money lenders in Nigeria.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>This is as a result of an instruction from the&nbsp;<a href="https://nibss-plc.com.ng/services/bvn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System Plc (NIBSS)</u></a>, that “<strong>individuals who are applying for loans must provide their Bank Verification Number to lenders so that their details can be confirmed from the Nigerian central database.”</strong></p>



<h2>WHAT IS A BANK VERIFICATION NUMBER (BVN)</h2>



<p><strong>A&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://nibss-plc.com.ng/services/bvn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><strong>Bank Verification Number (BVN)</strong></u></a><strong>&nbsp;is a code that identifies bank customers in Nigeria.</strong>&nbsp;This code is usually a set of numbers that is special for each customer; every customer that has registered and collected a BVN has a code that identifies only them.</p>



<p>When used, the set of numbers provide fast and easy identification of the individual that they have been assigned to. This quick identification can be used to verify account details for banking, lending and other money related purposes.</p>



<p>The identification system of the BVN is based on biometrics. Biometrics simply means the system uses physical features like fingerprints, facial features and the likes to confirm identity. In this case of the BVN, all 10 fingers and a facial image will be collected. Since every human being has a unique fingerprint (no two human beings can have the same fingerprints) it is an effective method of identification.</p>



<p>The Central Bank of Nigeria worked with all Nigerian banks to create the BVN, this means that the BVN is not owned by any specific bank. A BVN can be used by all banks and authorised individuals to easily confirm the identity of the owner.&nbsp;<strong>Bank customers that have BVN’s enjoy a reduced risk of fraudulent activities on their accounts because only authorised banks and individuals have access to their bank accounts linked to their BVN.</strong></p>



<h3>BENEFITS OF HAVING A BVN</h3>



<p>As stated above the Bank Verification Number was created to increase the security of bank accounts in Nigeria, so there are many benefits to having it. The benefits include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Account protection from fraudsters; the BVN keeps unauthorised individuals from gaining access to bank accounts of Nigerians</li><li>Unique identification;&nbsp; BVN makes it easy and fast to identify bank customers across all banks no matter the bank. It can be used as a means of Identification in any bank</li><li>Protection for money lenders; the BVN protects lenders from customers who only want to lend and not pay back. This is a major reason that most lenders require a BVN before giving out money</li></ul>



<h2>WHY DO LENDERS NEED A BVN</h2>



<p><strong>Lenders need your Bank Verification number (BVN) to confirm your identity.</strong>&nbsp;This provides them a form of safety net since they can use the BVN to check if you are who you really say you are. A BVN however cannot be used to access any bank account or be used to pay money into or collect money from any account by itself.</p>



<p>A BVN can only be used to access information about the owner of a bank account to confirm personal details. This does not mean that you should not be careful with who you share the details of your BVN with because the information it provides can be used in negative ways.</p>



<p>If you share your BVN with fraudsters, they cannot use the BVN alone to steal money from any of your accounts. But since the BVN can be used to check your identity details, they might try to use the knowledge of your identity to ask for your bank account details, ATM details and ATM pin. Once they have this, they can easily proceed to take money from your bank accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>HOW TO GET A BVN</h2>



<p>A Bank Verification number can be obtained from any branch of any bank. You walk into the branch of any bank and tell the customer care representative that you want to get a Bank Verification Number.</p>



<p>The customer care representative will present you with a BVN enrolment form which you have to fill right there with your personal details.</p>



<p>After you fill out the form, your biometrics will be captured. This is usually your ten fingerprints and a photograph of you, which will be taken by the customer care representative.</p>



<p>You will then be given a slip that confirms that you have enrolled for the BVN process. After a short period of time (from 24 hours to a few days), your BVN will be generated when the system confirms your application and you will receive the SMS to come back to the branch for pickup.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When shopping for a loan, your primary concern is to get the best rate possible. But what you might not]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When shopping for a loan, your primary concern is to get the best rate possible. But what you might not realize is that lenders advertise rates that do not represent the full cost of their loan.</p>



<p>So you go ahead and pick a lender that has the lowest interest rate. But at the end of the day, when the loan term is complete, you find that you&#8217;ve paid more than you expected.</p>



<p>Two numbers (expressed in percentages) represent a loan&#8217;s cost – the interest rate and the annual percentage rate (APR). Although they both show how much you have to pay for a loan, they are not the same.</p>



<h2>Interest rate vs. annual percentage rate (APR)</h2>



<p><strong>What is an interest rate?</strong>&nbsp;Putting it simply, an interest rate is the gain that a lender makes on their capital. It is the price you pay for borrowing.</p>



<p>For example, let&#8217;s say you take a car loan of N 600 000 at an interest rate of 10% per annum. Your annual interest payment would amount to N 60, 000, or N 5 000 per month.</p>



<p>Lenders assign different interest rates to borrowers. Your approved interest rate will depend on:</p>



<ul><li>The amount you borrowed</li><li>The loan term (shorter repayment periods typically attract lower interest rates)</li><li>Your monthly income</li><li>Your debt-to-income ratio</li><li>Your credit report</li></ul>



<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The final amount you pay on interest also depends on whether the loan repayment is&nbsp;<a href="https://creditnigeria.com/loan-repayment-schedule">amortized</a>&nbsp;or made on an interest-only (cash-on-cash) basis.</p>



<p><strong>What is an Annual Percentage Rate?</strong></p>



<p>APR is the total cost of a loan. It includes:</p>



<ul><li>The interest rate of your loan</li><li>All fees associated with the loan</li></ul>



<p>Just like interest rate, APR is also expressed as a percentage. The figure depends on the type of loan you are getting and the terms and conditions of the lender.</p>



<p>Different fees may come with your loan. They include, but not limited to:</p>



<ul><li>Application/processing fee</li><li>Ongoing administration fee</li><li>Late payment fee</li><li>Non-sufficient funds fee</li><li>Broker fee</li></ul>



<p>Some of these fees are negotiable, and some are not.</p>



<p>While an interest rate stipulates what you will pay monthly for your loan, APR, on the other hand, paints a broader picture of what the loan will cost you in full.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>When shopping for loans, get the best value by comparing the interest rate and APR of different lenders. One lender might have a lower interest rate but compensates for it by adding several fees that ultimately increase your loan cost. Other lenders, although they may have a higher interest rate, might not attach so many fees.</p>



<p>So, ensure that you make the necessary inquiries. Compare APRs and interest rates before committing to a loan. If you don&#8217;t have the capacity or the time to conduct the research yourself, we suggest using the services of <a href="/">Credit Nigeria</a>.</p>



<p>Credit Nigeria is an online loan platform that helps you locate loan offers that match your criteria. They make it easy for you to compare costs and pick the loan that is right for you. The service comes at no charge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When taking a loan, you can negotiate with the lender and agree on how you will repay the money. Getting the best repayment terms will go a long way to ensure that you can settle the loan comfortably.</p>



<p>Depending on what you are taking the loan for, you might be better off paying back the principal in one lump sum at the end of the loan tenure or chip off at it every month until the repayment period is complete.</p>



<p>For instance, if you take a loan to finance your business startup, you might want to repay the principal at the end of a specified period and make monthly interest payments throughout the life of the loan. This agreement will allow your business the time it needs to stand on its feet and start yielding enough profit to pay back the principal.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you’ve taken a car loan, making principal +&nbsp;<a href="https://creditnigeria.com/types-of-interest-rates-nigeria">interest payments</a>&nbsp;every month would make sense for any salary earner.</p>



<p>These arrangements are referred to as repayment schedules. Let’s take a look at how they affect your interest payments.</p>



<h2>Amortized repayment schedule</h2>



<p>For an amortized loan, payments are made in regular instalments that consist of both principal and interest. The interest to principal ratio is different for each month. Once the lender states your monthly payment, the repayment schedule is easy to calculate.</p>



<p>Let’s say you want to take a loan of N 100,000 at an interest rate of 12% and a repayment period of 1 year. Going for an amortized repayment schedule with a fixed monthly payment of N 8,884.9, there’s a formula that will help you figure out the interest you will pay monthly for 12 months.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://media.graphcms.com/CIPYrL1fT1Wmmhr7ZrL5" alt="Amortized repayment schedule.png" title="Amortized repayment schedule.png"/></figure>



<p>The interest payment for the first month is calculated as follows: 12% (Interest rate) * N100,000 (Principal) / 12 months (loan tenure) = N1000.</p>



<p>Subtracting N1,000 (Interest payment in Month 1) from N8884.9 (The stated monthly repayment) gives you N7,884.9, which is the principal repaid in Month 1. The principal repaid in Month 1 is then subtracted from the original amount you borrowed and carried down to Month 2.</p>



<p>You will notice that the money channelled toward interest payments is greater at the beginning of the repayment period and steadily decreases as the loan tenure approaches its end.</p>



<p>Conversely, the amount applied to principal payments is less at the beginning of the repayment period and keeps increasing as the loan tenure approaches its end.</p>



<p>One advantage of loan amortization is that borrowers can pay off the principal in manageable bits. The total interest payment is reduced since the principal gets paid down throughout the lifetime of the loan. The 12% interest is made on the outstanding principal balance each month so that the actual cost of the loan would be the sum of the interest payments (N6,619) and not N 12,000 (12% of N 100,000) as you might expect.</p>



<h2>Interest-only payments</h2>



<p>In this repayment agreement, you only make interest payments throughout the loan tenure and then pay back the principal at the end of the term.</p>



<p>Let us say you take N 100,000 at a 12% interest rate and 12 months repayment period. The repayment schedule would look like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://media.graphcms.com/A2z8ipsrQ7mRr9u9l2UM" alt="Interest only payments.png" title="Interest only payments.png"/></figure>



<p>As you can see, the monthly payment is specified by multiplying N 100,000 (the borrowed amount) by 12% and dividing the result by 12. The figures are purely interest payments from the 1st month to the 11th month. On the 12th month, you pay up the remaining interest in addition to the capital you borrowed.</p>



<p>This type of agreement is beneficial when you want to take advantage of a venture that will yield a considerable profit at a later date, making it possible for you to repay the borrowed funds in one lump sum.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Taking a loan entails an obligation to pay back, with interest. To ensure that you can make your payments comfortably, you need to discuss the repayment conditions with the lender. The purpose of the loan will determine the repayment method that will suit you well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are numerous reasons why one may consider taking a loan – Be it shopping for a new car, having a line of credit to fall back on during dry spells, paying for school, you name it.</p>



<p>And true, there are online lenders beyond counting that entice you with quick-access collateral-free loans. The advertised interest rates are often so attractive that you think to yourself, &#8216;Hey, I can handle it.&#8217;</p>



<p>But what you might not know is that some loan offers could be too good to be true. Why? Because interest rates can be presented in more than one way, meaning that there&#8217;s a lot in the background that the lender might not be telling you just yet.</p>



<p>So, if you don&#8217;t do your homework, you commit to a loan that you soon find difficult to settle. Even if you can pay back, you wind up spending more than you could have, assuming you got a better deal.</p>



<p>To make better choices, you need to get familiarised with these terms:</p>



<ul><li>Nominal interest rate</li><li>Effective interest rate</li><li>Annual Percentage Rate (ARP)</li></ul>



<p>They are different types of interest rates.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>



<h2>What is nominal interest rate?</h2>



<p>NIR is the interest rate you might be used to already. It is the one often found on financial institution profiles and loan adverts. It is also known as the base rate or coupon rate. NIR does not account for inflation or compounding.</p>



<p>But once the figure adjusts for inflation or compounds, there will be a significant increase in your interest payments.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Compounding means that the accrued interest is added to the principal, making you pay interest on the interest. It has a snowball effect, which is very favourable for investors. But for borrowers, it can be quite unpleasant.</p>



<h2>What is effective interest rate?</h2>



<p>Effective interest rate is what you have when the lender takes compounding into account. It is also known as the market rate of interest, yield to maturity, or annual percentage yield (APY).</p>



<p>The gap between the nominal and effective interest rates increases proportionately to the number of compounding periods within the tenure of your loan.</p>



<p>For example, Lender A offers a loan with a nominal interest rate of 8% and compounds every six months. Their offer will be more expensive than Lender B, whose nominal interest rate is also 8% but compounds annually.</p>



<p>Although they both have the same nominal interest rate of 8%, the effective interest rate of Lender A is much higher, and considerably so if you are going for a long term loan and a significant amount of money.</p>



<h2>What is annual percentage rate (APR)?</h2>



<p><a href="https://creditnigeria.com/interest-rate-apr-difference">APR</a>&nbsp;is interest repaid in a year along with any fees that the loan attracts. It can also be nominal or effective.</p>



<p>Nominal APR is the coupon/base rate you would repay in a year if the lender doesn&#8217;t factor in compounding. Effective APR adjusts for compounding.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>When shopping for a loan, you need to be more mindful as you compare lenders. The differences between nominal, effective, and annual percentage rates have a significant impact that should not be taken lightly.</p>



<p>A loan that compounds, say monthly, will be more expensive than another that compounds annually. Likewise, a loan that charges more fees, such as application fees, maintenance fees, late payment fees, and so on, will have a higher APR than one that charges considerably lower fees.</p>



<p>Ensure that you do some due diligence before committing to a loan, no matter how urgently it is needed. It will help save you some trouble down the road and keep your credit score blemish-free.</p>
