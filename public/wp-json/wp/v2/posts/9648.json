But what you might not realize is that lenders advertise rates that do not represent the full cost of their loan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you go ahead and pick a lender that has the lowest interest rate. But at the end of the day, when the loan term is complete, you find that you&#8217;ve paid more than you expected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two numbers (expressed in percentages) represent a loan&#8217;s cost \u2013 the interest rate and the annual percentage rate (APR). Although they both show how much you have to pay for a loan, they are not the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Interest rate vs. annual percentage rate (APR)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is an interest rate?<\/strong>&nbsp;Putting it simply, an interest rate is the gain that a lender makes on their capital. It is the price you pay for borrowing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, let&#8217;s say you take a car loan of N 600 000 at an interest rate of 10% per annum. Your annual interest payment would amount to N 60, 000, or N 5 000 per month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenders assign different interest rates to borrowers. Your approved interest rate will depend on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The amount you borrowed<\/li><li>The loan term (shorter repayment periods typically attract lower interest rates)<\/li><li>Your monthly income<\/li><li>Your debt-to-income ratio<\/li><li>Your credit report<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong>&nbsp;The final amount you pay on interest also depends on whether the loan repayment is&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/creditnigeria.com\/loan-repayment-schedule\">amortized<\/a>&nbsp;or made on an interest-only (cash-on-cash) basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is an Annual Percentage Rate?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>APR is the total cost of a loan. It includes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The interest rate of your loan<\/li><li>All fees associated with the loan<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like interest rate, APR is also expressed as a percentage. The figure depends on the type of loan you are getting and the terms and conditions of the lender.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Different fees may come with your loan. They include, but not limited to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Application\/processing fee<\/li><li>Ongoing administration fee<\/li><li>Late payment fee<\/li><li>Non-sufficient funds fee<\/li><li>Broker fee<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these fees are negotiable, and some are not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While an interest rate stipulates what you will pay monthly for your loan, APR, on the other hand, paints a broader picture of what the loan will cost you in full.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When shopping for loans, get the best value by comparing the interest rate and APR of different lenders. One lender might have a lower interest rate but compensates for it by adding several fees that ultimately increase your loan cost. Other lenders, although they may have a higher interest rate, might not attach so many fees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, ensure that you make the necessary inquiries.
